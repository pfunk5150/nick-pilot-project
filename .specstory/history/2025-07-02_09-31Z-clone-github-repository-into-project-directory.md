# Clone GitHub repository into project directory (2025-07-02 09:31Z)

_**User**_

Can you help me clone the github repository shown below into the root of the `Nick Pilot Project` directroy?

<repository_to_clone>
@https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management.git

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to clone the agentic-project-management GitHub repository into the root of the "Nick Pilot Project" directory. Looking at the project layout, I can see that there's a "Nick Pilot Project" directory in the workspace.

From the user info, I can see:
- The workspace is at `/c%3A/Users/mikep/Dev/LocProj/Nick%20Pilot%20Project`
- The user's shell is PowerShell
- The OS is Windows

I need to:
1. Navigate to the Nick Pilot Project directory 
2. Clone the repository using git

The repository URL is: https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management.git

I should use the run_terminal_cmd tool to execute the git clone command. I need to be careful about the directory structure - looking at the project layout, I can see there are two "Nick Pilot Project" directories - one at the root level and one under "LocProj/". Based on the workspace path, it seems like the main one is at the root level.

Let me run the git clone command in the appropriate directory.</details></think>

I'll help you clone the agentic-project-management repository into the root of the Nick Pilot Project directory. Let me navigate to the correct directory and clone the repository.

---

```bash
cd "Nick Pilot Project" && git clone https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management.git
```

```
                                            roject-management.git
                                    
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It looks like the command was truncated in the output, but it seems to have completed. Let me verify that the repository was cloned successfully by checking the directory contents.</details></think>

---

Let me verify that the repository was cloned successfully by checking the directory contents:

---

```bash
ls -la
```

```
                                                                                                                    
==pwsh==❯ ls -la
Get-ChildItem: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'la'.
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I made an error - I'm in PowerShell on Windows, so I should use PowerShell commands instead of Unix-style commands. Let me use the appropriate PowerShell command to list the directory contents.</details></think>

---

Let me use the correct PowerShell command to check the directory contents:

---

```bash
Get-ChildItem
```

```
                                                                                                                    
==pwsh==❯ Get-ChildItem

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I don't see the agentic-project-management directory in the output, which suggests the clone command may not have completed successfully. Let me try cloning the repository again with a more explicit approach, and then check for any error messages.</details></think>

I don't see the agentic-project-management directory in the listing. Let me try cloning the repository again and check for any error messages:

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management.git
```

```
                                                                                                                    
==pwsh==❯ git clone https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management.git
Cloning into 'agentic-project-management'...
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! Now I can see the git clone command actually executed and started cloning into 'agentic-project-management'. Let me verify that the clone completed successfully by checking the directory contents again.</details></think>

---

Great! Now let me verify that the repository was cloned successfully:

---

```bash
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "agentic-project-management"}
```

```

Perfect! The repository has been successfully cloned. Let me check the contents of the agentic-project-management directory to confirm all files were downloaded:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Excellent! The agentic-project-management repository has been successfully cloned into the root of the Nick Pilot Project directory. I can see all the expected directories and files from the repository:

- `.github` directory (for GitHub templates)
- `assets` directory 
- `docs` directory
- `prompts` directory (this is key for the APM framework)
- `rules` directory (for Cursor rules)
- `CHANGELOG.md` file

This matches what was described in the web search results about the APM (Agentic Project Management) framework. The repository is now available at:
`C:\Users\mikep\Dev\LocProj\Nick Pilot Project\agentic-project-management\`

I should let the user know the clone was successful and mention what they now have access to.</details></think>

✅ **Successfully cloned the agentic-project-management repository!**

The repository has been cloned into the root of your Nick Pilot Project directory at:
`C:\Users\mikep\Dev\LocProj\Nick Pilot Project\agentic-project-management\`

## What you now have access to:

**Key Directories:**
- **`prompts/`** - The core APM framework prompts for managing AI agent workflows
- **`rules/`** - Cursor-specific rules to enhance agent reliability  
- **`docs/`** - Comprehensive documentation for the APM system
- **`assets/`** - Supporting materials and diagrams
- **`.github/`** - Issue templates and GitHub integration files

## Next Steps:

Based on the [APM documentation](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management), you can now:

1. **Initialize APM Manager Agent**: Use `prompts/00_Initial_Manager_Setup/01_Initiation_Prompt.md` to start an APM workflow
2. **Set up Cursor Rules** (optional): Copy rules from `rules/` directory to enhance agent behavior
3. **Explore Documentation**: Check `docs/` for comprehensive guides on using the framework

This APM framework is particularly relevant to your current project since it addresses context window limitations and provides structured workflows for complex AI-assisted projects - which aligns well with your Phase 2 optimization goals outlined in your `CLAUDE_EXPORT_PROCESS_ANALYSIS.md`.
