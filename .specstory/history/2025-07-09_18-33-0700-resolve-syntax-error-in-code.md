# Resolve syntax error in code (2025-07-09 01:33Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Syntax error: Syntax error in text: Parse error on line 22:
...itial<br/>MAXED OUT (414KB)<br/>26 Artif
-----------------------^
Expecting 'SQE', 'DOUBLECIRCLEEND', 'PE', '-)', 'STADIUMEND', 'SUBROUTINEEND', 'PIPE', 'CYLINDEREND', 'DIAMOND_STOP', 'TAGEND', 'TRAPEND', 'INVTRAPEND', 'UNICODE_TEXT', 'TEXT', 'TAGSTART', got 'PS'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error, it appears to be a Mermaid syntax parsing issue. The error suggests there's a problem with the text content in the node definitions, likely due to special characters or formatting.

Let me examine the problematic lines and fix them:

The fix removes problematic characters that were causing the Mermaid parser to fail:
- Removed parentheses `()` from `(414KB)` → `414KB`
- Removed the `%` symbol from `95%` → `95 Percent`
- Removed the underscore `_` from `HANDOFF_PRIME` → `HANDOFF PRIME`

These characters can interfere with Mermaid's parsing engine. The diagram should now render properly while maintaining the same visual information.
