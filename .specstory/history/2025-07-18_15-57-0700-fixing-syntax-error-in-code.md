# Fixing syntax error in code (2025-07-17 22:57Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Syntax error: Syntax error in text: Parse error on line 12:
...fff3e0    intent: "request_human_input"
----------------------^
Expecting 'SEMI', 'NEWLINE', 'SPACE', 'EOF', 'AMP', 'COLON', 'START_LINK', 'LINK', 'LINK_ID', 'DOWN', 'DEFAULT', 'NUM', 'COMMA', 'NODE_STRING', 'BRKT', 'MINUS', 'MULT', 'UNICODE_TEXT', got 'STR'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

I can see the issue in the Mermaid diagram syntax. The problem is on line 12 where you're trying to add properties to a node style, but Mermaid doesn't support arbitrary properties like `intent`, `question`, and `context` directly in the diagram syntax.

Let me fix this by removing the invalid syntax:

---

Could not find file 'Untitled-1' in the workspace.

---

Read file: mermaid_diagrams/Untitled-1.mmd

---

The error is at line 12 (which is actually around line 11-14 in the selection you showed). The issue is that there are invalid properties being added after the style definition. In Mermaid, you can only define styles, not arbitrary metadata.

Let me fix this by removing the invalid syntax:

---

The fix was to move the `style H fill:#fff3e0` to the proper location in the Mermaid diagram (after the node definitions) and remove the invalid properties (`intent`, `question`, `context`) that aren't supported by Mermaid syntax.

The diagram should now render correctly. If you need to include that metadata, you would typically add it as comments or in a separate documentation section rather than as node properties in the Mermaid syntax.

I see the issue - there are still invalid properties after the style definition. Let me remove those completely:


---



---

Let me check the current state of the file:


---

Read file: mermaid_diagrams/Untitled-1.mmd

---

The file looks correct now. The error you're seeing might be from a different file or cached content. The Mermaid diagram in `mermaid_diagrams/Untitled-1.mmd` should now render without syntax errors since I've removed the invalid properties (`intent`, `question`, `context`) that were causing the parse error.

The diagram now only contains valid Mermaid syntax with the style definition properly placed after the node definitions.

I see the issue - you're still looking at a file that has the invalid properties. Let me check if there's another file with this content:
