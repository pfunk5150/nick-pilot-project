# Convert bash commands to PowerShell (2025-07-10 08:11Z)

_**User**_

can you convert these bash commands to the powershell equivalent lines (7-17) of the attached file?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Translating Bash Commands**

I'm currently focused on translating the specified bash commands into their PowerShell equivalents. Specifically, I'm working on `./scripts/init -session.sh` and `./scripts/merge-session.sh`. I've begun to break down the commands, identifying key components to translate.


**Assessing PowerShell Equivalents**

I've examined the bash commands and their corresponding PowerShell options.  The existing `.ps1` files in the `scripts` directory appear to be the direct counterparts. Now, I'm verifying the functionality of `init-enhanced-session.ps1` and `merge-session.ps1`, which likely mirror `init-session.sh` and `merge-session.sh`. I need to ensure seamless translation.


**Pinpointing PowerShell Scripts**

I'm now identifying the PowerShell scripts corresponding to the specified bash commands. I have confirmed the existence of  `init-enhanced-session.ps1` and have discovered `init-session.sh` and `merge-session.sh` amongst the file listings in the `scripts` directory. My focus is on determining if these are the direct PowerShell counterparts. The evidence points towards their use.

Of course. I will convert the bash commands to their PowerShell equivalents in the `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` file. First, I will list the files in the `Nick Pilot Project/scripts/` directory to identify the correct PowerShell script names.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Mapping Commands to PS**

I'm currently working on converting the bash commands from the specified Markdown file to PowerShell. I've noted the existing PowerShell scripts in the "scripts" directory, which should help with the mapping process. I'll focus on `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` and `init-enhanced-session.ps1` as relevant examples.


**Investigating Command Mappings**

I've examined the `scripts` directory and identified potential PowerShell equivalents for the bash scripts referenced in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`. While exact matches for `init-session.sh` and `merge-session.sh` are missing, I'm leaning toward `init-enhanced-session.ps1` for initialization. The role of `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` in relation to `merge-session.sh` warrants further investigation. I'm focusing on the subtle differences in functionality.


**Resolving Discrepancies**

I've clarified the discrepancies between the expected and actual script names in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`. It now appears `init-enhanced-session.sh` is the correct reference, and `init-enhanced-session.ps1` is its PowerShell counterpart. The purpose of `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` in relation to `merge-session.sh` remains under scrutiny, considering the absence of a direct `merge-session.ps1`. My focus is now on mapping the remaining bash commands, bearing in mind the potential for naming inconsistencies.


**Identifying PowerShell Mappings**

I've confirmed the discrepancies between the specified script names in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` and the actual directory contents. It now appears that `init-enhanced-session.sh` is the intended script, with `init-enhanced-session.ps1` as its PowerShell equivalent. I'm leaning toward interpreting `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` as the function related to the bash script in question, even if the names don't match. To further understand the relationship, I'm currently using `grep_search` to find instances of `merge-session.sh` within the project, hoping to solidify the mapping.


</details></think>

Based on the file listing, it appears the script names in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` might be slightly outdated. The available scripts are:
*   `init-enhanced-session.ps1` (and `.sh`)
*   `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` (and `.sh`)
*   `cleanup-project.ps1`
*   `init-git-repository.sh`

It seems `init-enhanced-session.ps1` is the correct PowerShell script for starting a new session.

To find the correct PowerShell equivalent for `merge-session.sh`, I'll search the codebase to see if there are any references or clues about its replacement or PowerShell counterpart.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adapting Bash Scripts**

I'm currently working on converting the bash scripts in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` to PowerShell. I've identified `./scripts/init-session.sh` and `./scripts/merge-session.sh` as the target commands. My previous directory listing of `Nick Pilot Project/scripts` confirmed the presence of the `validate-merge-` script, too. I'm focusing on ensuring functional equivalence during the conversion.


**Analyzing Script Dependencies**

I've discovered `init-git-repository.sh` *generates* `merge-session.sh` and likely `init-session.sh`. My initial directory listings were misleading since these scripts are created dynamically. Now, I'm examining `init-git-repository.sh` to understand the logic behind script generation and dependencies. This knowledge is crucial for a correct PowerShell conversion.


</details></think>

---

The plot thickens! My previous search revealed that `merge-session.sh` is actually *created* by another script, `init-git-repository.sh`. This explains why it didn't appear in the initial directory listing. It's likely that `init-session.sh` is generated in the same way.

I'll examine the contents of `Nick Pilot Project/scripts/init-git-repository.sh` to confirm this and to understand what the PowerShell equivalents should be.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing Script Comprehension**

I realized my initial approach was flawed; I failed to specify the scope of my file read in the previous attempt. To grasp the script's entirety, I've corrected my approach and opted to read the whole file content. This should provide a more comprehensive understanding of the original intent.


</details></think>

---

My apologies, I made an error in my last request. I'll correct it now by reading the entire `init-git-repository.sh` script to understand how it generates other scripts.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Converting Bash Commands**

I've examined the `init-git-repository.sh` script, which confirms the creation of `init-session.sh` and `merge-session.sh`. My focus is shifting to translating these bash commands into their PowerShell equivalents within `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`. I'm starting to identify key areas for conversion.


**Revising Command Translations**

I'm reconsidering the initial bash-to-PowerShell translation based on the project's evolution. The original scripts `init-session.sh` and `merge-session.sh` are likely replaced by `init-enhanced-session.ps1` and `validate-merge-candidate.ps1`. I'll update the `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` to reflect these revised script names and the corresponding changes in functionality.


**Adjusting Command Syntax**

I'm now revising the translation, focusing on updating the `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` content with the suggested PowerShell commands and syntax. The earlier identified `init-enhanced-session.ps1` and `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` will replace the older Bash versions. My focus now is to ensure the formatting and the file language hints in the markdown are all properly updated. I will also incorporate appropriate backslashes in the PowerShell execution commands, along with the correct path conventions.


**Refining Script References**

I'm now focusing on replacing the original bash command calls within `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`. Considering the project's evolution, I've identified the more appropriate PowerShell scripts: `./scripts/init-enhanced-session.ps1` and `./scripts/validate-merge-candidate.ps1`. My plan is to update the file and change the language to "powershell". The format will use `./` to make it more cross-platform.


**Analyzing Merge Candidate**

I've examined `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` to understand its role. It appears to validate merge prerequisites, not perform the merge itself. Now, I'm considering if another script handles the actual merge operation or if the merge process is streamlined within the `validate-merge-candidate.ps1`. My focus is on determining the exact command to represent "Merging Approved Work" within the PowerShell workflow. I need to be sure that the given script is not missing any part of the workflow.


</details></think>

Okay, I see what's happening. The `init-git-repository.sh` script generates the `init-session.sh` and `merge-session.sh` scripts, which explains why they weren't in the initial file listing.

However, your workspace also contains more recently updated scripts: `init-enhanced-session.ps1` and `validate-merge-candidate.ps1`. These appear to be the intended PowerShell-based workflow.

I'll proceed with editing `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` to use these newer PowerShell scripts. I'm going to quickly check the content of `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` to ensure it's the correct script for merging.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Defining Script Function**

I've examined the script `validate-merge-candidate.ps1`. My initial understanding, confirmed by reading, is that this script is purely a validator. It assesses code quality and compliance but doesn't actually merge anything.


**Exploring PowerShell Alternatives**

I've been investigating PowerShell's role in the merging process. After analyzing `validate-merge-candidate.ps1`, it's clear it's a validation step, not a merger. My current focus is identifying the best PowerShell equivalent for the bash commands used for merging in the legacy script. The options I'm considering involve either providing clear instructions for manual merging post-validation or building a new PowerShell script to handle the merge directly.


**Refining the Merge Strategy**

I've clarified the script's function, confirming it's a validator. My focus has shifted from direct PowerShell equivalents to clarifying the post-validation merge process for the user. Analyzing the script's logic, I propose using `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` and updating comments for a manual merge. I'll outline the updated `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` section to reflect this, using the existing scripts and ensuring clarity on their individual roles in the updated process. This direction offers a more practical solution.


**Defining Merge Instructions**

I've determined the best approach is to leverage the existing `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` script for validation. After analyzing its purpose and function, I'll update the script to clarify that it's a validation step, not a direct merge tool. The updated `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` section will provide clear instructions on how to use `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` and manually merge approved work, maintaining clarity and accuracy.

After reviewing `validate-merge-candidate.ps1`, I can see it's a validation script that provides the final git merge commands as "Next steps" rather than performing the merge itself. This is a change from the old `merge-session.sh` script.

Therefore, I will update `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` to reflect the current process. I'll replace the bash commands with their corresponding PowerShell scripts and adjust the comments to accurately describe their new functions.

- ./scripts/init-session.sh
+ ```powershell
+ ./scripts/init-enhanced-session.ps1
  # Follow prompts to create session branch
  ```
  
  ### Merging Approved Work
- ```bash
- ./scripts/merge-session.sh
- # Review changes and confirm merge
+ ```powershell
+ ./scripts/validate-merge-candidate.ps1
+ # Run validation and follow merge instructions
  ```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reflecting PowerShell Changes**

I've replaced the bash commands in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` with their PowerShell counterparts, and the comments now accurately reflect the updated workflow. This fulfills the user's request, and I'm ready to move on.


**Completing the Transition**

I've finalized the edits to `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`, incorporating PowerShell commands and clarifying comments to depict the updated process. This addresses the user's initial prompt entirely, and the updated file is now ready for review.

I have updated the `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` file to replace the bash commands with their modern PowerShell equivalents.

I've replaced `init-session.sh` with `init-enhanced-session.ps1` for starting a session. For merging, I've used `validate-merge-candidate.ps1` and updated the comment to reflect that it's a validation script that provides instructions for completing the merge.
