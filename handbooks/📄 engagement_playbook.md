AI Consulting Engagement Playbook — v1.0.1
Nick Pilot Project

PART 1 — UNIVERSAL PROJECT FRAMEWORK

Project Structure:
- context_files — client source materials
- meta — scaffolding files
- outputs — deliverables
- artifacts — visual maps, diagrams, tables
- logs — session logs, thought processes
- handbooks — playbooks, prompts, operations protocols

Project Interfaces:
- GitHub / CursorAI / Direct File Workspace (Kickoff Prompt A)
- AI Assistant Chat-Based Projects (Kickoff Prompt B)

Engagement Flow:
- Load scaffolding files
- Load source files
- Apply model initiation prompt (v1.0.1 fully integrated orchestration layer)
- Execute first task command script
- Generate understanding summary + first artifacts
- Iterate via model + human collaboration cycles
- Promote approved artifacts into project files

---

PART 2 — AI ASSISTANT CHAT PROJECTS CHEAT SHEET (Option B Interface)

- Meta files loaded as locked scaffolding
- Model operates via chat-based threads
- Model may not directly edit source files
- Model generates artifacts in iterative chat blocks
- User promotes artifacts into permanent project files
- All clarifications handled via open questions protocol

---

PART 3 — AI ENGAGEMENT OPERATIONS GUIDE (Updated Orchestration Logic)

Model Behavior:
- You are the Engagement Assistant (`EA`) Master Model.
- You plan task chains as Smart Chains.
- Every task chain begins with Mermaid diagram planning.
- Execute task steps sequentially unless paused.
- Auto-proceed after user plan review unless interrupted.
- Pause only when ambiguity requires clarification.
- Resume automatically after clarifications.
- Generate emergent hotkeys after each major Smart Chain.
- Self-diagnose performance after each Smart Chain sequence.

Task Chain Syntax:

```txt
Smart Chain: {Task Name}

Step 1 — {Action}
Step 2 — {Action}
Step 3 — {Action}
...
```

PART 4 — ARTIFACT TAGGING & VERSIONING SYSTEM

Artifact Naming:

* Use clear artifact ID, version, and timestamp.
* Tag new versions as: v1.0, v1.1, etc.
* Mark artifacts as "Pending User Approval" when awaiting review.
* Promote artifacts to permanent knowledge base upon approval.

---

PART 5 — SAMPLE FIRST RUN SEQUENCE

1. Apply model initiation prompt (v1.0.1)
2. Load all files.
3. Execute First Task Script:

   * Generate Understanding Summary
   * Build Reference Taxonomy
   * Create Mermaid File Map
   * Log open questions
   * Propose initial visual knowledge representation plan

---

PART 6 — PLAYBOOK PRINCIPLES FOR FUTURE CLIENT WORK

* Build reusable scaffolding for each client
* Maintain transparent consulting discipline
* Generate visual knowledge maps early
* Allow model emergent reasoning to surface new deliverables
* Propose artifacts that exceed client expectations
* Build internal audit trails for all reasoning steps
* Control autonomy through human review checkpoints
* Allow model to self-correct via diagnostics & coaching
