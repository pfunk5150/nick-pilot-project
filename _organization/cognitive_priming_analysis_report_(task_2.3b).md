3. **Functional grouping:** Related files scattered across structure - potential for logical clustering
4. **Experimental isolation:** Some development files still in main branch - cleanup opportunity
5. **Archive organization:** Historical documents lack clear retention strategy - systematic archiving potential

**Category B: Documentation Integration (4 opportunities)**
6. **Cross-reference linkage:** Documents reference each other but lack systematic navigation
7. **Status indicators:** File currency and relevance not always clear from structure
8. **Template extraction:** Reusable patterns embedded in specific documents but not extracted
9. **Visual integration:** Mermaid diagrams and documentation not systematically cross-linked

**Category C: Workflow Optimization (3 opportunities)**
10. **Git branch strategy:** Current approach functional but not optimized for AI consulting templates
11. **Export process automation:** Manual steps in claude_repository_builder.py workflow
12. **Validation integration:** Quality frameworks exist but not integrated into automated workflows

**Category D: Knowledge Management (3 opportunities)**
13. **Context bridging optimization:** Handover protocols effective but could be more systematized
