## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

1️⃣ Place full file manifest into your root project directory.
2️⃣ Run `Initialize-AIEngagementProject.ps1` (PowerShell bootstrap) to automatically structure directories.
3️⃣ Validate successful deployment (all subfolders populated correctly).
4️⃣ Begin system bootstrapping via `prime.md` sequence.

## MODEL ACTIVATION FLOW

* PRIME File: Load all core files in correct order.
* Generate Context Summary Report after ingestion.
* Await further human instruction.
* Enter Smart Chain Orchestration Mode.
* Execute controlled consulting engagement under human-in-the-loop guidance.

---

## AI BEHAVIORAL SAFEGUARDS

* Full reasoning transparency
* No silent task execution
* Self-Diagnostics required after every major Smart Chain
* Hotkey scaffold generation for emergent subtasks
* User retains final authority at all times

---

## ORCHESTRATION DESIGN SUMMARY

* ✅ Smart Chain Task Planning (Mermaid Visual Plans)
* ✅ Emergent Task Decomposition
* ✅ Self-Diagnostics & Coaching Layer
* ✅ Knowledge Map Expansion
* ✅ Meta-Architecture Alignment
* ✅ Hotkey Command Surface Generation
* ✅ Visual Knowledge Representation Planning (VKR)

---

## VERSION HISTORY

* ✅ v1.0 — Initial Build Sequence
* ✅ v1.0.1 — Full Orchestration Merge, PRIME Command Stabilization, Directory Normalization

---

## SYSTEM DESIGN PRINCIPLE

> "**Task Networking → Hierarchical Planning → Smart Chain → Emergent Hotkeys → Transparent Work Product → Self-Diagnostics → Continuous Improvement.**"

---

*This repository represents a full-stack AI consulting engagement system architecture — fully reusable, fully auditable, and scalable.*
