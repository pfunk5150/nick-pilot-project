# Git Attribution Quick Reference for Cursor AI

## 🎯 **CURSOR AI COMMANDS**

### **Reference Specific Commits in Chat**
```
@da76905 = AI baseline (diagnostics/ai_baseline_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md)
@71ce813 = User enhanced (diagnostics/user_enhanced_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md)
```

### **Pull Diffs into Context**
```bash
# Show user changes vs AI baseline
git diff da76905..71ce813 -- diagnostics/

# Show specific file changes
git diff da76905:diagnostics/ai_baseline_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md diagnostics/user_enhanced_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md
```

### **Blame Analysis for Line Attribution**
```bash
# See who wrote each line (AI vs User)
git blame diagnostics/user_enhanced_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md
```

## 🚀 **CURSOR AI USAGE PATTERNS**

### **For Error Analysis:**
```
Hey Cursor, I need to fix the issues identified in @71ce813.
Focus on the user feedback sections that ask about Git workflow.
```

### **For Understanding Context:**
```
@da76905 shows the original AI analysis. @71ce813 shows my corrections.
Please review both to understand where the AI made wrong assumptions.
```

### **For Building on Previous Work:**
```
Use the comparison in diagnostics/ai_vs_user_comparison_analysis.md
to understand the collaborative editing pattern we've established.
```

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION COMMANDS**

**This strategy was implemented using:**
```bash
# 1. Create AI baseline
git add diagnostics/ai_baseline_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md
git commit -m "AI: Post-remediation quality assessment baseline"

# 2. Create user enhanced version
cp diagnostics/post_remediation_quality_assessment.md diagnostics/user_enhanced_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md
git add diagnostics/user_enhanced_post_remediation_quality_assessment.md
git commit -m "User: Enhanced post-remediation assessment with corrections and feedback"

# 3. Generate comparison analysis
git diff --no-index [baseline] [enhanced] > analysis
```

**Result:** Perfect attribution and Cursor AI integration! 🎉
