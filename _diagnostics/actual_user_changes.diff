 - **Root Directory Count:** 22 items (DOWN from 24 - ‚úÖ IMPROVED)
 - **Professional Threshold:** Target ‚â§15 items (‚ùå Still 47% over limit)
 - **Organization Quality:** Good categorization but needs final consolidation
+- **User Feedback:** "I‚Äôm stll unclear how the `./_session_integration/` files fit into the multi-branch Git workflow alongside the `./tools/` directory. Specifically:
+
+ 1. When should I create a new branch for a Claude.ai webchat session, and how does it relate to the master branch and its baseline files?
+ 2. Are the APM-related files kept on master or branched?
+ 3. Could you provide a Mermaid diagram illustrating the Git workflow, including multi-threaded Claude.ai sessions, directory structure, and where each file set lives?
+ 4. Could we walk through a full example of the workflow from start to finish with the existing exported claude.ai webchat session all the way through the Context Bridge and HANDOFF_PRIME v2.0?"

 - **Manual Validation Required:** logs/README.md missed ‚ùå
 - **Current Accuracy:** ~95% (down from 100% due to logs/README.md)

 - **Branch Strategy:** ‚úÖ COMPLIANT - Following enhanced workflow
 - **Documentation:** ‚úÖ CURRENT - Matches actual implementation
+- **User Feedback:** see feedback above,  I need a clear Mermaid diagram (or set of diagrams) that illustrates:

+ 2. How parallel Claude.ai webchat sessions map onto those branches.
+ 3. The role of each directory (e.g., `./_session_integration/`, `./tools/`) within this process.
+
+ Please provide concise visual representations and brief captions explaining each part.

 - **Session Integration:** ‚úÖ ALIGNED with HANDOFF_PRIME v2.0
 - **APM Enhancement:** ‚úÖ PRESERVED throughout remediation
 - **Visual Architecture:** ‚úÖ CONSISTENT with cognitive priming optimization
+- **User Feedback:**  are the diagrams in the `./mermaid_diagrams/` directory as clear and concise as they could be? Review all Mermaid files in `./mermaid_diagrams/` (e.g., `master_architecture_framework_v2.mmd`, `task_2.1_system_architecture_v3.mmd`) and (all key files) and evaluate whether they communicate the project clearly at three abstraction levels:
+
+ 1. **High-Level Overview:** A single simple diagram for newcomers, showing core workflows and dual-model structure.
+ 2. **Mid-Level Detail:** A more structured diagram with key components and their interactions.
+ 3. **Full Detail:** The existing, complex diagrams as fallback.
+
+Propose diagram formats, naming conventions, and progressive layout strategies (e.g., layering, drill-down, or zoom-levels), following a ‚ÄúPaul Graham clarity‚Äù style.
