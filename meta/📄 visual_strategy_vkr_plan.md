Visual Knowledge Representation (VKR) Plan

Purpose:
- Capture and evolve potential diagrams, frameworks, and visuals that help explain ILPA templates to Nickâ€™s target audience.

Current VKR Concepts:
- Reporting Template Process Flow
- Data Hierarchy Model for Fund Reporting
- Stakeholder Interest Map (LPs, GPs, ILPA Committees)
- Change Timeline Visualization

--- OPEN QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ---
- [ ] Do we want visuals comparing prior vs updated ILPA templates?
- [ ] Do we know which sections of the templates generate the most debate?
