Outstanding Clarifications Needed:

- [ ] Which ILPA committee does Nick serve on?
- [ ] What are the key points of debate among stakeholders?
- [ ] Are any of the "redline" or "comment period" files tied to current committee disputes?
- [ ] Should we prioritize reporting or performance templates first?
- [ ] Are there specific sections Nick wants to emphasize or avoid in public commentary?
- [ ] A sample reference article has been provided. Use structure, format, and tone as later-stage style guidance, but do not prematurely constrain topic depth or argument development based on this sampleâ€™s brevity.
