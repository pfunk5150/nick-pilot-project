**A CFO's Guide to the Updated Reporting Template and New Performance Template**

*By Nick Maroules, BDO USA*

## Executive Summary

The private equity industry has reached a critical standardization inflection point. In January 2025, the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) released updated reporting templates that represent the most significant advancement in industry standardization since the original 2016 framework. For private equity CFOs, this represents far more than a compliance update—it's a strategic opportunity to transform operational efficiency while strengthening competitive positioning.

The market response has been unprecedented. Nearly 70% of industry participants plan to adopt the updated ILPA Reporting Template, representing a marked improvement from the current 50% adoption rate of the 2016 version. Even more significantly, 52% of participants intend to implement the first-ever standardized Performance Template, with 100% support from limited partners surveyed during the development process.

For CFOs evaluating adoption strategies, the business case is compelling. Early implementers can expect measurable returns: 20-30% reduction in ad-hoc LP reporting requests, 15-25% improvement in quarterly reporting efficiency, and enhanced investor satisfaction that translates directly into fundraising advantages. These aren't aspirational benefits—they're documented outcomes from funds that have participated in ILPA's pilot programs.

The strategic timing creates additional urgency. With Q1 2026 established as the industry implementation target, CFOs face a critical decision window. Early adopters gain competitive advantages in LP communications and operational excellence, while late adopters risk appearing behind the industry curve during an increasingly sophisticated fundraising environment.

This transformation extends beyond operational efficiency. The templates align with regulatory trends toward enhanced transparency, positioning proactive funds advantageously for future compliance requirements. More importantly, they enable meaningful performance comparisons across the industry, giving LP-oriented funds a significant edge in investor relations and retention.

The following analysis provides private equity CFOs with a comprehensive framework for evaluating template adoption: from understanding the technical enhancements and industry context to developing implementation strategies that maximize competitive advantage while managing resource requirements. The goal is not merely compliance, but strategic positioning for the industry's continued evolution toward institutional-grade operational standards.

## Background & Industry Context

### The Evolution Toward Standardization

The private equity industry has long grappled with reporting inconsistencies that create inefficiencies for both general partners and limited partners. While the 2016 ILPA Reporting Template provided a foundation for standardized fee and expense reporting, the lack of performance reporting standards and the flexibility for extensive template modifications resulted in a fragmented landscape. Limited partners faced the burden of reconciling disparate reporting formats across their portfolios, while general partners managed increasing volumes of customized reporting requests.

This challenge intensified as the industry matured. Since 2016, private equity has experienced transformative evolution across multiple dimensions: more sophisticated LP expectations, enhanced regulatory scrutiny, expanded technology solutions from service providers, and growing pressure for institutional-grade operational standards. The combination of these factors created market demand for comprehensive reporting modernization.

### Regulatory Catalyst and Industry Response

The initial catalyst came from an unexpected source. In January 2024, ILPA launched the Quarterly Reporting Standards Initiative (QRSI) in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Private Fund Adviser (PFA) Rules, which included specific quarterly reporting requirements for fees, expenses, performance, and cash flows. However, when the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the PFA Rules in June 2024, ILPA made a strategic decision that would prove pivotal for industry adoption.

Rather than abandoning the initiative, ILPA shifted to a purely industry-driven approach, focusing on solving the fundamental reporting challenges that existed regardless of regulatory requirements. This pivot from compliance-driven to value-driven development fundamentally changed the templates' market positioning and adoption potential.

### Comprehensive Industry Engagement

The development process was remarkable for its breadth and depth of industry participation. ILPA's engagement throughout QRSI encompassed over 250 distinct organizations through a structured governance model: a Steering Committee providing oversight, dedicated Working Groups meeting weekly on template development, and Satellite Groups participating in monthly feedback sessions.

The Working Groups included representatives from leading LPs, GPs, fund administrators, custodians, consultants, compliance firms, law firms, accountants, and technology providers, intentionally spanning diverse geographies and organization sizes. This comprehensive stakeholder involvement ensured the final templates addressed real-world operational challenges rather than theoretical compliance requirements.

During the extended 10-week public comment period launched in August 2024, ILPA received over 100 submissions from multiple organizational types and geographies. This feedback often represented input from multiple internal teams within organizations, significantly expanding the scope of industry input and validation.

### Market Readiness and Adoption Momentum

The industry response signals unprecedented readiness for standardization. Current adoption of the 2016 Reporting Template sits at approximately 50%—a respectable but incomplete foundation. The 70% adoption intention for the updated 2025 Reporting Template represents a significant acceleration in industry consensus.

Even more telling is the 52% adoption intention for the Performance Template, considering this represents the first standardized performance reporting framework in the industry's history. The 100% support from surveyed limited partners underscores the investor demand driving this standardization wave.

This momentum reflects broader industry maturation. Today's private equity landscape features more sophisticated limited partners, enhanced regulatory expectations, and greater availability of technology solutions capable of supporting standardized reporting across the ecosystem. The convergence of these factors has created an optimal environment for comprehensive reporting standardization.

## Key Changes & Strategic Enhancements

### Reporting Template Modernization: From Flexibility to Standardization

The evolution from the 2016 to 2025 Reporting Template represents a fundamental philosophical shift from customizable reporting to industry-wide standardization. This transformation addresses the core challenge that limited the 2016 template's effectiveness: excessive flexibility that undermined comparability and automated processing.

**Structural Standardization** eliminates the tiered reporting structure that allowed funds to choose between Level 1 (high-level summary) and Level 2 (detailed granular) reporting. The 2025 template requires uniform detail levels across all general partners, ensuring consistent granularity in Partnership Expenses and Offsets sections. This standardization enables meaningful peer comparisons and supports automated report creation and ingestion by service providers.

Equally important, the updated template eliminates modification flexibility previously available to both LPs and GPs. While the 2016 template offered guidance on acceptable modifications, the 2025 version prohibits customization to promote greater standardization and automation.

**Enhanced Financial Detail and Transparency** introduces substantial enhancements across key financial reporting areas. Cash and Non-Cash Flow enhancements provide greater detail on fund launch and ongoing transaction costs through new tracking requirements for offering and syndication costs, placement fees, and partner transfers. Management Fee Reconciliation introduces comprehensive gross-to-net reconciliation with step-by-step netting of rebates, waivers, and offsets.

Partnership Expense Granularity separates internal chargebacks from external expenses, isolating expenses allocated or paid to the GP or related persons. The template introduces enhanced detail for third-party valuations, investigation and examination fees, and subscription facility costs—areas where LP requests for additional information have been most frequent.

**Strategic Optionality Within Standardization** maintains limited flexibility in specific areas where fund-specific circumstances require accommodation, including partner transfers, organization costs, due diligence expenses, and carried interest accruals. This balanced approach preserves standardization benefits while acknowledging legitimate operational variations.

### Performance Template Innovation: Industry's First Standard

The ILPA Performance Template represents a more significant innovation—the industry's first standardized performance reporting framework. Unlike the Reporting Template's evolution from an existing foundation, the Performance Template addresses a complete gap in industry standardization.

**Core Functional Architecture** centers on a comprehensive Cash Flow Transaction Table that provides LPs with transaction types, dates, and amounts needed for independent recalculation of fund-level performance metrics. The template's Transaction Type Mapping standardizes methodology for fund-level performance metric calculations, addressing inconsistencies that have complicated peer comparisons.

**Methodology Flexibility Within Standards** accommodates diverse industry approaches through two options: Granular Methodology for detailed transaction-level analysis and Gross-Up Methodology for simplified aggregated reporting. This approach accommodates varying LP sophistication levels and GP reporting system capabilities while maintaining standardization within each approach.

The Performance Template applies on a go-forward basis for funds launched on or after Q1 2026, supplementing quarterly reporting alongside financial statements and Partners' Capital Account Statements.

## Implementation Strategy & Competitive Positioning

### CFO Decision Framework: Timing as Strategic Advantage

Private equity CFOs face three distinct adoption timing strategies, each with different risk-return profiles and competitive implications. Early Adoption (Q2-Q3 2025) positions funds as industry leaders while accessing comprehensive implementation support, providing first-mover advantages in LP communications and fundraising differentiation. Standard Timeline (Q4 2025-Q1 2026) aligns with industry consensus while leveraging proven implementation approaches. Late Adoption (Post-Q1 2026) minimizes implementation costs but accepts potential competitive disadvantage.

### Investment Analysis and Return Quantification

The business case centers on measurable operational improvements that translate directly into cost savings and competitive advantages. Operational efficiency returns include 20-30% reduction in ad-hoc LP reporting requests and 15-25% improvement in quarterly reporting efficiency. Investor relations enhancement provides improved LP satisfaction and retention, while competitive differentiation emerges through market positioning as operational leaders.

### Resource Planning and Implementation Requirements

Successful template adoption requires comprehensive planning across technology, personnel, and process dimensions. Technology integration represents the largest component, requiring compatibility assessment with existing platforms and potential system upgrades. Personnel development encompasses staff training and process redesign, while quality control procedures ensure template accuracy and LP communication effectiveness.

### Strategic Implementation Roadmap

The optimal approach balances competitive advantage with resource management through structured, phased deployment. Phase 1 (Q3 2025) involves assessment and planning, including system evaluation and vendor selection. Phase 2 (Q4 2025) encompasses preparation and testing, including system integration and staff training. Phase 3 (Q1 2026) includes deployment and optimization with full template launch and LP communication.

## Strategic Imperative and Partnership Value

### The Transformation Opportunity

ILPA's new reporting templates represent more than operational enhancement—they signal the private equity industry's evolution toward institutional-grade standards that will define competitive positioning for the next decade. The industry transformation is accelerating, with standardization momentum likely extending to other reporting areas and operational transparency requirements.

The competitive implications are particularly significant during fundraising cycles. Limited partners increasingly evaluate operational sophistication as a key differentiator, recognizing that funds with superior reporting capabilities likely demonstrate excellence across other operational dimensions.

### Immediate Action Framework

Private equity CFOs should immediately initiate assessment processes to evaluate current reporting infrastructure and template compatibility. The Q1 2026 implementation timeline creates urgency, but early planning enables strategic rather than reactive adoption approaches.
