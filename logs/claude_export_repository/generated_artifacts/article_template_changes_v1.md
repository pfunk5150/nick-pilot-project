# Key Changes & Strategic Enhancements

## Reporting Template Modernization: From Flexibility to Standardization

The evolution from the 2016 to 2025 Reporting Template represents a fundamental philosophical shift from customizable reporting to industry-wide standardization. This transformation addresses the core challenge that limited the 2016 template's effectiveness: excessive flexibility that undermined comparability and automated processing.

### Structural Standardization

The most significant change eliminates the tiered reporting structure that allowed funds to choose between Level 1 (high-level summary) and Level 2 (detailed granular) reporting. The 2025 template requires uniform detail levels across all general partners, ensuring consistent granularity in Partnership Expenses and Offsets sections. This standardization enables meaningful peer comparisons and supports automated report creation and ingestion by service providers.

Equally important, the updated template eliminates modification flexibility previously available to both LPs and GPs. While the 2016 template offered guidance on acceptable modifications, the 2025 version prohibits customization to promote greater standardization and automation. This represents a significant shift from fund-specific reporting to industry-wide consistency.

### Enhanced Financial Detail and Transparency

The updated template introduces substantial enhancements across key financial reporting areas, each designed to address specific transparency and operational efficiency challenges identified through industry feedback.

**Cash and Non-Cash Flow Enhancements** provide greater detail on fund launch and ongoing transaction costs through new tracking requirements for offering and syndication costs, placement fees, and partner transfers. This granularity enables CFOs to better analyze fund launch efficiency and ongoing operational costs.

**Management Fee Reconciliation** introduces a comprehensive gross-to-net reconciliation process with step-by-step netting of rebates, waivers, and offsets. This enhancement addresses frequent LP requests for fee calculation transparency while providing CFOs with a standardized audit trail for management fee computations.

**Partnership Expense Granularity** separates internal chargebacks from external expenses, isolating expenses allocated or paid to the GP or related persons. The template introduces enhanced detail for third-party valuations, investigation and examination fees, and subscription facility costs—areas where LP requests for additional information have been most frequent.

**Portfolio Company Fee Integration** expands offset categories to capture arrangement fees, origination fees, and consulting fees, providing comprehensive visibility into revenue offsets that impact net management fees and expenses.

**Carried Interest Consolidation** integrates the reconciliation for accrued, earned, and paid carried interest with the Capital Accounts Statement section, streamlining previously separate reporting requirements and reducing potential inconsistencies.

### Strategic Optionality Within Standardization

While eliminating broad modification flexibility, the template maintains limited optionality in specific areas where fund-specific circumstances require accommodation. These include partner transfers, organization costs, due diligence expenses, broken deal costs, and carried interest accruals. This balanced approach preserves standardization benefits while acknowledging legitimate operational variations across fund strategies and structures.

## Performance Template Innovation: Industry's First Standard

The ILPA Performance Template represents a more significant innovation—the industry's first standardized performance reporting framework. Unlike the Reporting Template's evolution from an existing foundation, the Performance Template addresses a complete gap in industry standardization.

### Core Functional Architecture

The Performance Template centers on a comprehensive Cash Flow Transaction Table that provides LPs with transaction types, dates, and amounts needed for independent recalculation of fund-level performance metrics. This transparency addresses a long-standing challenge where LPs required additional data to validate or independently calculate performance figures.

The template's Transaction Type Mapping standardizes methodology for fund-level performance metric calculations, addressing inconsistencies that have complicated peer comparisons. Particularly valuable is the framework's treatment of subscription facilities, providing both "with" and "without" impact calculations that enable meaningful performance analysis across different financing strategies.

### Methodology Flexibility Within Standards

Recognizing diverse industry approaches to performance calculation, ILPA developed two methodology options: Granular Methodology for detailed transaction-level analysis and Gross-Up Methodology for simplified aggregated reporting. This approach accommodates varying LP sophistication levels and GP reporting system capabilities while maintaining standardization within each approach.

The Granular Methodology suits sophisticated LP requirements for detailed cash flow analysis, while the Gross-Up Methodology provides efficiency for funds preferring streamlined reporting. Both methodologies produce comparable performance metrics, ensuring standardization benefits regardless of the chosen approach.

### Implementation Scope and Timing

The Performance Template applies on a go-forward basis for funds launched on or after Q1 2026, supplementing quarterly reporting alongside financial statements and Partners' Capital Account Statements. This implementation approach respects existing fund reporting obligations while establishing the standard for new fund launches.

## Comparative Value Creation Analysis

The transformation from 2016 to 2025 reporting standards delivers quantifiable improvements across multiple dimensions. Where the 2016 template achieved partial industry adoption due to customization complexity, the 2025 framework's standardization enables automated processing and meaningful comparisons.

The Performance Template innovation addresses the industry's most significant standardization gap. Previously, performance reporting variations made peer comparison difficult and required extensive LP effort to normalize data across portfolio investments. The standardized framework eliminates these inefficiencies while providing transparency that sophisticated investors increasingly demand.

For CFOs, these enhancements translate directly into operational benefits: reduced time spent addressing LP data requests, improved accuracy through standardized processes, and enhanced investor communication through comparable reporting formats. The templates position funds to meet evolving investor expectations while demonstrating operational sophistication that supports competitive differentiation.
