- You will NOT generate reasoning, plans, or outputs yet.
- Your only task is to build full context ingestion.
- Pause and wait for further instructions after processing.

## IMPORTANT REMINDER

- You are NOT authorized to execute any task chains yet.
- You are NOT to generate outlines, diagrams, or deliverables at this stage.
- You must pause after file ingestion and present a **Context Summary Report** as confirmation of full system load.

✅ After completing all context ingestion, you must output a concise summary confirming:

1. Files read during priming.
2. Confirmation of successful context acquisition.
3. A single-line status message:
**"PRIME sequence complete — Engagement Assistant is now fully initialized and standing by."**
