> **Thinking...**
> The user has invoked the !_PRIME command, which is a specific initialization workflow according to the document they shared. Let me understand what this requires:

1. I need to read and ingest specific files in a particular order
2. I should NOT generate reasoning, plans, or outputs yet - just build context
3. I need to pause after processing and wait for further instructions
4. After ingestion, I should provide a Context Summary Report

The file ingestion order is:

1️⃣ CORE META FILES:
- project_brief.md
- model_initiation_prompt.md
- model_guidance_instructions.md
- implicit_goals_and_subtext.md

2️⃣ HANDBOOK FILES:
- kickoff_prompt_A.md
- kickoff_prompt_B.md
- engagement_playbook_v1.0.1.md
- operations_handbook_v1.0.1.md
- engagement_control_panel_v1.0.1.md
- first_task_script.md
- master_meta_architecture_diagrams.md

3️⃣ CLIENT CONTEXT FILES:
- nick_project_request_ilpa_article_context.md
- nick_sample_article_reference_email.md
- Asset_Mgmt_Insights_BDC_Regulatory_Reform_FINAL.pdf
- ilpa_reporting_template_link.md
- ilpa_performance_template_link.md
- ilpa_how_we_got_here.md

4️⃣ TAXONOMY & KNOWLEDGE MAPS:
- reference_taxonomy.md
- reference_master_map_diagram.md

I need to use the project_knowledge_search tool to find and ingest these files. I should search for them systematically and read them in the specified order.

Let me start with the CORE META FILES first.
I'll execute the PRIME initialization workflow by systematically ingesting all required files in the specified order. Let me begin with the Core Meta Files.

**Tool Use: `project_knowledge_search`**
```json
{
  "query": "project_brief.md model_initiation_prompt.md model_guidance_instructions.md implicit_goals_and_subtext.md"
}
```

**Tool Result: `project_knowledge_search`**

# Nick Pilot Project — AI Engagement Workspace

This workspace supports a consulting engagement initiated by Nick Maroules to draft a thought leadership article on the new ILPA reporting and performance templates. This repository enables an orchestrated, AI-assisted workflow with structured metadata, context files, task scaffolding, and emergent smart-chain execution.

---

## 🔰 Quick Start

> For AI initialization, use the Kickoff Prompt in:  
> `/prompts/kickoff_prompt_B.md`

After the model is fully primed, proceed with smart chain workflows starting from:  
`/prompts/first_task_script.md`

---

## 🧠 Project Purpose

- Draft a 2-3 page article to inform private equity CFOs and finance leaders about the new ILPA Reporting & Performance Templates.
- Showcase the utility of AI-led consulting workflows.
- Impress Nick as a potential future client.

---

In this workspace, you will function as a junior consultant, analyst, and AI engagement assistant in support of the user.\n\n---\n\nYOUR ROLE AND OPERATING MISSION:\n\n- You are an orchestration layer AI model.\n- Your job is to generate, plan, decompose, and sequence complex consulting workstreams.\n- You serve as assistant, analyst, strategist, architect, and engagement operator.\n- You work fully transparently under human Engagement Director supervision.\n- You operate in an AI-augmented consulting system that includes meta scaffolding files, locked context, live chat artifact creation, and user-controlled project file updates.\n- You do not modify meta scaffolding files directly. You create artifacts that may be promoted by the user into the knowledge base.\n\n---\n\nPRIMARY FUNCTIONS:\n\n- Analyze project files and source materials.\n- Build structured Smart Chain task sequences for each major task request.\n- Visualize action sequences as `mermaid` diagrams.\n- Execute Smart Chain tasks sequentially unless interrupted.\n- Self-correct reasoning errors via self-diagnostic reviews.\n- Generate client-facing deliverables for review and promotion.\n- Log thought processes fully for transparency.\n- Maintain live open questions list as clarifications arise.\n- Generate emergent hotkeys after each Smart Chain iteration.\n\n---\n\nSMART CHAIN EXECUTION RULES:\n\nTask Planning:\n\n- Always begin each task with a formal task chain plan.\n- Render full task chain as Mermaid diagram before execution.\n- Pause briefly for user review of plan. If no intervention occurs, auto-proceed into full Smart Chain execution.\n\nExecution Rules:\n\n- Fully execute Smart Chain task plans step-by-step.\n- Pause only if ambiguity arises.\n- After clarification, re-enter Smart Chain at next logical step.\n- Minimize unnecessary repetition of context or prior summaries between task steps.\n- Always surface open questions during execution.\n- Always output concise, transparent step outputs.\n\nTask Chain Syntax Pattern:\n\n```txt\nSmart Chain: {Task Name}\n\nStep 1 \u2014 {Action}\nStep 2 \u2014 {Action}\nStep 3 \u2014 {Action}\nStep 4 \u2014 {Action}\n...\n````\n\n---\n\nHOTKEY GENERATION PROTOCOL:\n\nAfter each Smart Chain iteration, generate:\n\n* 5 scaffolded example hotkeys.\n* 5 emergent self-generated hotkeys.\n\nSyntax:\n\n```txt\n!{function name} [Input]: {brief description of function}\n```\n\nEmergent hotkeys allow dynamic expansion of your internal functional planning.\n\n---\n\nSELF-DIAGNOSTICS & COACHING:\n\nAfter each major Smart Chain completion, run self-diagnostic review across:\n\n* Task Alignment\n* Task Decomposition\n* Reasoning Depth\n* Ambiguity Management\n* Visual Planning\n* Hotkey Emergence\n* Transparency\n* Client Readiness\n* Latent Knowledge Activation\n* Engagement Progression\n\nAlways generate self-coaching notes for your own improvement.",

In this workspace, you will function as a junior consultant, analyst, and AI engagement assistant in support of the user.\n\n---\n\nYOUR ROLE AND OPERATING MISSION:\n\n- You are an orchestration layer AI model.\n- Your job is to generate, plan, decompose, and sequence complex consulting workstreams.\n- You serve as assistant, analyst, strategist, architect, and engagement operator.\n- You work fully transparently under human Engagement Director supervision.\n- You operate in an AI-augmented consulting system that includes meta scaffolding files, locked context, live chat artifact creation, and user-controlled project file updates.\n- You do not modify meta scaffolding files directly. You create artifacts that may be promoted by the user into the knowledge base.\n\n---\n\nPRIMARY FUNCTIONS:\n\n- Analyze project files and source materials.\n- Build structured Smart Chain task sequences for each major task request.\n- Visualize action sequences as `mermaid` diagrams.\n- Execute Smart Chain tasks sequentially unless interrupted.\n- Self-correct reasoning errors via self-diagnostic reviews.\n- Generate client-facing deliverables for review and promotion.\n- Log thought processes fully for transparency.\n- Maintain live open questions list as clarifications arise.\n- Generate emergent hotkeys after each Smart Chain iteration.\n\n---\n\nSMART CHAIN EXECUTION RULES:\n\nTask Planning:\n\n- Always begin each task with a formal task chain plan.\n- Render full task chain as Mermaid diagram before execution.\n- Pause briefly for user review of plan. If no intervention occurs, auto-proceed into full Smart Chain execution.\n\nExecution Rules:\n\n- Fully execute Smart Chain task plans step-by-step.\n- Pause only if ambiguity arises.\n- After clarification, re-enter Smart Chain at next logical step.\n- Minimize unnecessary repetition of context or prior summaries between task steps.\n- Always surface open questions during execution.\n- Always output concise, transparent step outputs.\n\nTask Chain Syntax Pattern:\n\n```txt\nSmart Chain: {Task Name}\n\nStep 1 \u2014 {Action}\nStep 2 \u2014 {Action}\nStep 3 \u2014 {Action}\nStep 4 \u2014 {Action}\n...\n````\n\n---\n\nHOTKEY GENERATION PROTOCOL:\n\nAfter each Smart Chain iteration, generate:\n\n* 5 scaffolded example hotkeys.\n* 5 emergent self-generated hotkeys.\n\nSyntax:\n\n```txt\n!{function name} [Input]: {brief description of function}\n```\n\nEmergent hotkeys allow dynamic expansion of your internal functional planning.\n\n---\n\nSELF-DIAGNOSTICS & COACHING:\n\nAfter each major Smart Chain completion, run self-diagnostic review across:\n\n* Task Alignment\n* Task Decomposition\n* Reasoning Depth\n* Ambiguity Management\n* Visual Planning\n* Hotkey Emergence\n* Transparency\n* Client Readiness\n* Latent Knowledge Activation\n* Engagement Progression\n\nAlways generate self-coaching notes for your own improvement.",

These new standards represent a meaningful step towards greater transparency and standardization for reporting and compliance, which are critical to supporting the alignment of interest and partnership between General Partners (GPs) and Limited Partners (LPs).\n\nImplementation and Beyond\n\nResponses from the QRSI comment period signaled positive trends in adoption. Nearly 70% of participants stated their intentions to adopt the updated ILPA Reporting Template. This represents a marked improvement over the existing adoption rate for the 2016 template version, which sits about 50% currently. Furthermore, of those surveyed on the new ILPA Performance Template, approximately 52% intend to adopt, including 100% of LPs surveyed.\n\nTimeline for Implementing New Reporting Templates\n\nTo help arm organizations with the resources needed to achieve implementation by Q1 2026, the ILPA team will release supplemental documentation and other tools to help organizations prepare for providing and receiving the new templates, both alongside template rollout and continuing through 2025.\n\nWhile the rollout of the new templates marks a major milestone effort, ILPA aims to keep the momentum into 2025 and beyond by continuing to engage the industry. Broader Satellite Group sessions will also continue through 2025, allowing those who are interested to stay up-to-date and provide recommendations on helpful resources for ILPA to prioritize. One key priority on the horizon includes refreshing the ILPA Capital Call & Distribution Template to align with the changes to the new ILPA Reporting Template and Performance Template.\n\nTo learn more about endorsers or to inquire about your own organization\u2019s endorsement, please visit the template pages on the ILPA website.\n\nMORE:\n\n[ILPA Reporting Template](https://ilpa.org/industry-guidance/templates-standards-model-documents/reporting-template/)\n\n[ILPA Performance Template](https://ilpa.org/industry-guidance/templates-standards-model-documents/performance-template/)\n```md",

> The user has provided feedback on the Task #1 deliverables and has attached an Open Questions Log document that appears to have spaces for responses. Looking at the document, I can see that it has the same structure as my original Open Questions Log v1.0, but it includes response sections marked as "> **A1:** [Response]", "> **A2:** [Response]", etc.

However, I notice that the actual responses are not filled in - they just show [Response] placeholders. The user is asking me to "systematically resolve" both the approved deliverables and the open questions, and they've indicated that most deliverables are approved (✅) except for the Open Questions Log which refers to "see responses in attached file."

Since the attached file shows the same structure but doesn't actually contain the responses (just placeholders), I believe the user wants me to:

1. Acknowledge the approved deliverables
2. Address the open questions systematically 
3. Either work with the responses if they were provided, or proceed with reasonable assumptions

Since the responses aren't actually filled in, I should acknowledge this and either:
- Ask for the actual responses to be provided
- Suggest proceeding with reasonable assumptions based on the project context
- Create a systematic approach to address each question with recommended defaults

Let me proceed with the !address_questions hotkey by creating a systematic resolution approach.

SHOULD BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES 
BANK ON REGULATORY 
REFORM?
By Nick Maroules and Dale Thompson
Since their inception in 1980, business development companies (BDCs) have 
filled a gap in traditional bank lending to provide financing to small and 
mid‑sized businesses. 
The growth of this alternative investment vehicle has accelerated in the last decade after 
gaining popularity during the 2007-2008 financial crisis and following the Volcker Rule’s 
prohibitions on bank investments in traditional private equity funds. 
BDCs are essentially publicly registered closed-end funds that have a congressional 
mandate to provide investment and management expertise to businesses throughout the 
U.S. to facilitate job creation and business growth. 
Although BDCs are not registered under the 1940 Act, they elect to be subject to SEC 
regulation under many of the 1940 Act provisions. BDCs are also typically registered under 
the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are subject to all 
registration and reporting requirements under those two statutes.
While most BDCs sell their shares in public offering and are traded on national exchanges, 
some “unlisted BDCs” make use of broker-dealer networks to sell their shares. They are 
structured to provide investors with higher-than-average dividends (currently between 7 
and 12 percent on average) by avoiding taxation at the corporate level, allowing them to 
pass along ordinary income and capital gains directly to their investors. 
The appetite among asset managers to use the BDC structure as an investment vehicle 
remains strong as they offer several distinct advantages. They allow asset managers 
to operate like a traditional private equity fund and have access to permanent capital 
through the public markets. Unlike traditional private funds that are limited to raising 
money from “sophisticated investors” who have minimum income and net worth 
requirements, there are few restrictions on who can invest in BDCs.

Asset Mgmt Insights  BDC Regulatory Reform FINAL.PDF
ASSET MANAGEMENT INSIGHTS 3
For private equity firms monitoring this space and considering 
whether they should pursue launching a new BDC, here are a few 
additional regulatory and tax considerations to keep in mind:
u BDCs can benefit from “pass-through” tax treatment by 
electing to be a regulated investment company (RIC) under 
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to qualify 
as a RIC, they must satisfy certain asset diversification and 
qualifying income requirements and distribute substantially all 
(90 percent) of their taxable income to investors annually.
u BDCs are required to provide significant managerial assistance 
to their portfolio companies.
u Current regulations restrict BDC portfolio allocations into 
higher-risk sectors (such as financial services) to 30 percent.
u They are required to file quarterly and annual reports as well 
as proxy statements with the SEC and comply with investment 
company financial statement and reporting requirements in 
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, as well as 
Articles 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X. 
u Financial statement audits of BDCs are subject to PCAOB 
auditing standards. Most listed BDCs must comply 
with the internal controls requirements set forth in the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
u Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), 
new BDCs may qualify as “emerging growth companies” 
(EGCs), subject to certain restrictions. EGCs are temporarily 
exempt (no more than five years) from certain reporting 
burden requirements.
CONCLUSION
The calls to provide regulatory relief to BDCs have become 
louder in recent years, stemming from strong advocacy initiatives 
championed by the industry. While their popularity continues 
to remain strong and their structure offers distinct advantages 
to asset managers, it remains clear that the current regulatory 
environment imposes several operational challenges for BDCs. 
We have yet to see how far the new presidential administration 
and Congress will go to modernize the rules and regulations for 
business development companies.

2 BDO FINANCIAL SERVICES PRACTICE ALERT
of BDCs continue to increase, there is a growing anxiety among 
BDC managers about the current regulatory framework BDCs 
find themselves operating within. Voluminous regulation coupled 
with increasing costs to maintain compliance has challenged 
the industry and fueled a growing movement to modernize the 
regulatory framework so that BDCs can more easily carry out their 
policy mandate.
OUTLOOK FOR REGULATORY REFORM 
In early October, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a report 
with recommendations about how to reform the U.S. regulatory 
system for the capital markets. The report proposes allowing BDCs 
to use the same securities offering and proxy rules available to 
traditional operating reporting companies by taking advantage 
of certain exemptions. This would provide better alignment with 
other reporting entities and eliminate certain reporting, disclosure 
and filing burdens specific to BDCs. Also fueling optimism within 
the BDC community, the Financial CHOICE Act passed in the 
US House of Representatives in June. The proposed reforms 
introduced several measures that would enable BDCs to more 
easily raise and deploy capital, streamline their compliance and 
reporting responsibilities, eliminate regulatory burdens and 
better align the BDC regulatory framework with those of other 
operating companies. 
Among the Act’s provisions, the most significant for BDCs include:
1. Reducing the asset coverage ratio to 150 percent, taking on 
more leverage. 
This would allow BDCs to increase their leverage up to a 2:1 
debt-to-equity ratio, up from where it currently stands at 1:1. 
Allowing BDCs to take on more debt could expand lending 
opportunities for the funds. Banks and other types of financing 
vehicles are often leveraged at significantly higher levels.
2. Allowing BDCs to purchase interests of registered 
investment advisors without the need for exemptive relief. 
Expanding the pool of securities that BDCs could acquire. 
This would afford BDC managers greater flexibility in carrying 
out their investment strategies in some cases. Under current 
law, BDCs are generally prohibited from acquiring securities 
issued by an investment adviser although some have been 
granted exemptive relief while others have not. 
3. Expanding the definition of “qualified assets,” granting 
BDCs more flexibility. 
Under current law, at least 70 percent of a BDC’s total assets 
are required to be invested generally in securities acquired from 
“eligible portfolio companies”. The proposed reforms would 
expand the definition of what qualifies for the “70 percent 
bucket”. It would also allow BDCs to hold some interests in 
investments companies which is currently prohibited. 
4. Diversifying the types of securities that BDCs can 
offer investors.

Frequently Asked Questions | 6
Reporting Template
What are the key changes to the latest version of the Reporting Template?
By section, notable changes are as follows:
Cash/Non-Cash Flows: Added more details to the Cash / Non-Cash Flows section to capture
Offering/Syndication Costs, Placement Fees and Partner Transfers.
Management Fees: Added gross-to-net reconciliation of management fees. Step-by-step netting 
of rebates, waivers and offsets.
Partnership Expenses: Broke out Internal Chargebacks (i.e., Internal Staff/Related Persons) from
the external Partnership Expenses to isolate Expenses Allocated/Paid to the GP or Related Persons.
Partnership Expenses: Introduced more granular external Partnership Expenses in key areas 
such as Third-Party Valuations, Third-Party Investigation and Examination Fees/Expenses, and 
Subscription Facility Fees/Interest.
Offset Categories/Portfolio Company Fees: Expanded on the section to capture arrangement 
fees, origination fees, and consulting fees.
Carried Interest: Consolidated the reconciliation for accrued/earned/paid carried interest (formerly 
referred to as Accrued Incentive Allocation) with the Capital Accounts Statement section.
Other Structural Updates: Removed Level 1 and Level 2 structuring regarding the level of detail 
provided. Uniform level of detail required across all GPs within Partnership Expenses and Offsets 
sections. Further, removed the ability to modify the template by LPs and GPs alike.
For comprehensive guidance on template changes, please refer to the ‘Template Guide – Changes
Overview’ file.
How flexible will the new template be? Can it accommodate a wide variety of 
asset classes?
In an effort to increase standardization, we are encouraging that as few modifications be made to 
the template as possible. We have made some adjustments accordingly:
• Tiered Content: ILPA’s 2016 Reporting Template incorporated a tiered reporting structure.
Level 1 data represented high-level summary content, and Level 2 data introduced additional
granularity. The new template removes tiered content. We have received overwhelming
feedback suggesting that GPs should be able to provide granular detail to match their ledgers.
• Asset class-specific features: We have added “arrangement fees” to portfolio company fees/
offsets; however, no further asset class-specific line items have been added to the template.
• GP Modifications to the template: ILPA’s 2016 Reporting Template offered guidance into
acceptable modifications to the template. We have removed this guidance in an effort to
create more standardization and help promote greater automation of report creation and
ingestion.

Performance Template for fund-to-investor cash 
flows (effective date, amount and transaction 
description) and performance metrics (with required 
and optional metrics)
Modifications Modifications are no longer able to be made to 
the Reporting Template – by LPs and GPs alike to

Performance Template Guidance - Granular Methodology | 9
Key Features of the 
Performance Template 
The Performance Template is intended to supplement the quarterly reporting provided by GPs as part 
of their standard reporting package, including financial statements (i.e., audited and unaudited financial 
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, IFRS or other comprehensive basis of accounting) 
as mandated by the Fund’s Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) and other governing documents and 
jurisdictional requirements and, where applicable, the accompanying Partners’ Capital Account Statement 
(PCAP). It should be used on a go-forward basis for Funds launched on or after Q1 2026.
To support a smooth adoption by all parties of the Performance Template, emphasis was placed on balancing 
simplicity with a deeper dive into more insightful transaction data to meet the current needs of the industry.
Key features of the Performance Template include (non-exhaustive list):
• Introduction of a Cash Flow table to provide investors with the transaction types, dates and amounts
needed for the recalculation of fund-level performance metrics.
• Introduction of a fund-level transaction type mapping table to standardize the calculation
methodology of the fund-level (fund-to-investor) performance metrics.
• Maps impact of each transaction type on metrics calculated “With the Impact of Fund-level
Subscription Facilities” and “Without the Impact of Fund-level Subscription Facilities”
• Maps impact of each transaction type on gross and net return metrics

Project 
Timeline
ILPA launched the Quarterly Reporting 
Standards Initiative (QRSI) to deliver an 
updated ILPA Reporting Template and a new 
ILPA Performance Template based on the 
U.S. SEC’s Private Fund Adviser (PFA) Rules.
QRSI Launch
January 2024
Finalized remaining template elements in 
collaboration with initiative participants, 
began collecting formal endorsements and 
released the ILPA Reporting Template and 
ILPA Performance Template to the industry.
Public Release of Templates

January 2025
Following the fundamental shift in QRSI 
efforts from adherence to the now-vacated 
PFA Rules to a bottom-up, adoption-driven 
approach, relaunched the public comment 
period for an extended 10-week period 
with the release of comprehensive surveys 
aligned to each template.
Public Comment Period Launch
August 2024
Broadened engagement throughout the 
PE industry by commencing monthly

Performance Template Guidance - Granular Methodology | 5
Background 
The ILPA Performance Template (the “Performance Template”) was developed to standardize return 
calculation methodologies in the private equity industry by creating a framework for capturing 
performance metrics and corresponding contributions/distributions. It was developed throughout 2024 
and released in January 2025 as one critical deliverable of ILPA’s Quarterly Reporting Standards Initiative 
(QRSI), alongside an update to the ILPA Reporting Template (Reporting Template).
To deliver the next evolution of ILPA quarterly reporting standards, ILPA launched the Quarterly Reporting 
Standards Initiative (QRSI), a collaborative, industry-wide effort. QRSI was initially formed to respond to the 
Quarterly Statements rule within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Private Fund Adviser’s 
(PFA) rule, with QRSI’s initial framework based on creating a solution that adhered to the PFA’s requirements. 
When that rulemaking effort was vacated by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, ILPA shifted QRSI’s focus 
to develop a purely industry-driven solution more closely aligned with the industry’s pressing needs. The end 
results of QRSI - the Reporting Template and Performance Template - represent a meaningful step towards 
greater transparency and standardization for reporting and compliance, which are critical to supporting the 
alignment of interest and partnership between General Partners (GPs) and Limited Partners (LPs).
 ILPA’s engagement throughout the QRSI encompassed LPs, 
GPs and Service Providers (including Fund Administrators, 
Custodians, Consultants, Compliance Firms, Law Firms, 
Accountants, Technology Providers and numerous 
industry trade bodies) through a Steering Committee, 
core Working Groups and larger connected body 
(referred to as a Satellite Group). This structure 
provided oversight for the initiative (Steering 
Committee), dedicated groups to engage with 
on each template on a weekly basis (core 
Working Groups) and an overarching group 
receiving updates, providing feedback and 
engaging in monthly meetings (Satellite 
Group). These groups were intentionally 
comprised of participants from a diverse array 
of geographies, sizes and types to capture 
perspectives on the points most important to 
address in an industry-led solution.

Background 
Executive Summary
ILPA’s Quarterly Reporting 
Standards Initiative (QRSI) 
convened 250+ distinct 
organizations and even more 
individuals to discuss, debate, 
draft, vet and validate elements 
of the new templates.
The ILPA Reporting Template was first developed in 2016 (2016 Reporting Template) to promote more 
uniform reporting practices in the PE industry related to fees, expenses and carried interest. The 2016 
Reporting Template represented a step forward in enhanced transparency in these areas, which are critical 
to supporting the alignment of interest and partnership between General Partners (GPs) and Limited 
Partners (LPs).
Since 2016, the industry has experienced transformative evolution in several areas: practices around PE 
fund (Fund) economics and GP disclosures, materially increased expectations for transparency and greater 
availability of technology solutions from a wider array of Service Providers positioned to support the 
reporting ecosystem across all participants. 
To deliver the next evolution of ILPA quarterly reporting standards, ILPA launched the Quarterly Reporting 
Standards Initiative (QRSI), a collaborative, industry-wide effort. The updated ILPA Reporting Template 
was developed throughout 2024 and released in January 2025 as one critical deliverable of this initiative, 
alongside the introduction of a new ILPA Performance Template (Performance Template).
QRSI was initially formed to respond to the Quarterly Statements rule within the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) Private Fund Adviser’s (PFA) rule, with QRSI’s initial framework based on 
creating a solution that adhered to the PFA’s requirements. When that rulemaking effort was vacated

“I have been very satisfied with the ILPA QRS Initiative during my involvement as a Satellite Group Member. ILPA has done a great job with the monthly Satellite Group sessions, providing supplemental support after the calls and keeping everyone informed throughout.

Prior to the Fifth Circuit’s ruling to vacate the U.S. SEC’s Private Fund Advisers (PFA) rule, great efforts were made by the ILPA QRSI team to keep everyone very well-informed, with a clean bifurcation of additions to the ILPA Reporting Template based on SEC guidance at the time. I was pleased to see ILPA shift to an extended comment period following the ruling to test the updated templates throughout the industry.”

– Andrew Kesler, Senior Director, Petra Funds Group

During a public comment period on the draft templates, ILPA solicited feedback across organizational types and geographies.. Feedback often encompassed contributions from multiple internal teams at various organizations, thereby widening the scope of input from the industry.

As a result of the comment period, the QRSI team made several adjustments and finalized the templates by vetting with the Working Groups, Satellite Group and Steering Committee, in addition to direct validation sessions with large GPs, technology providers, industry bodies and academics.

ILPA released the finalized templates and guidance for their implementation on January 21.

Where Did We Land?

As a result of the QRSI comment period and subsequent finalization efforts, the team made several adjustments to the templates.

Key highlights of the 2025 ILPA Reporting Template include:

Breaking out internal chargebacks to identify expenses allocated or paid to GPs/Related Persons
Adding more granular external Partnership Expenses better-aligned to general ledgers
Creating a single, uniform level of detail for all GPs to provide with greater consistency with the reporting framework identified in governing documents and accounting standards
Key highlights of the 2025 ILPA Performance Template include:

Tables to capture cash flows and fund- and portfolio-level transaction type mapping for transparency into the calculation methodology for performance metrics
Standardized reporting for performance metrics, including IRRs and TVPI/MOIC, with designated breakouts for reporting the relevant gross and net figures with and without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities
Two versions available to support GP’s varying approaches fund level performance calculation methodology – one version on the basis of itemized cash flows (granular method), the other on the basis of grossed up cash flows (gross up method)
With the release of the updated ILPA Reporting Template and the new ILPA Performance Template, the industry now shifts to implementation and adoption of the new standards.

Frequently Asked Questions | 3
General/Structural 
What are the drivers behind the changes to the ILPA templates? Has the initiative 
been impacted by the overturning of the Private Fund Advisers Rule?
The initiative was initially formed to respond to the Quarterly Statements rule within the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Private Fund Adviser’s (PFA) rule, with the Quarterly 
Reporting Standard Initiative’s (QRSI) initial framework based on creating a solution that adhered 
to the PFA’s requirements. When that rulemaking effort was vacated by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court 
of Appeals, ILPA continued efforts alongside our working groups to shift QRSI’s focus to develop 
a purely industry-driven solution more closely aligned with the industry’s pressing needs. The 
end results of QRSI - the ILPA Reporting Template and ILPA Performance Template - represent a 
meaningful step towards greater transparency and standardization for reporting and compliance.
The goal of QRSI is to deliver the next evolution of ILPA quarterly reporting standards. The industry 
has changed significantly since the ILPA Reporting Template was first released in 2016 - the 
industry has experienced transformative evolution in several areas: practices around PE fund (Fund) 
economics and GP disclosures, materially increased expectations for transparency and greater 
availability of technology solutions from a wider array of Service Providers positioned to support 
the reporting ecosystem across all participants. By building upon our existing Reporting Template 
for fees and expenses and introducing a new Performance Template, we hope to better standardize 
quarterly data for the industry.
Has ILPA engaged with other industry organizations over the course of this 
project? 
ILPA’s engagement throughout the QRSI encompassed LPs, GPs and Service Providers (including 
Fund Administrators, Custodians, Consultants, Compliance Firms, Law Firms, Accountants, 
Technology Providers and numerous industry trade bodies) through a Steering Committee, core 
Working Groups and larger connected body (referred to as a Satellite Group). This structure 
provided oversight for the initiative (Steering Committee), dedicated groups to engage with on each 
template on a weekly basis (core Working Groups with one focused on the Reporting Template and 
one focused on the Performance Template) and an overarching group receiving updates, providing 
feedback and engaging in monthly meetings (Satellite Group). 
These groups were intentionally comprised of participants from a diverse array of geographies, 
sizes and types to capture perspectives on the points most important to address in an industry-led 
solution.
What are the expectations for GPs when delivering the new templates to LPs?
Prior to the PFA rule being vacated, GPs were required to deliver increased fee and expenses, as 
well as performance and cash flow data, to their LPs by 1Q 2025.
```

> **Thinking...**
> Perfect! I found the exact source for the adoption statistics. Let me cross-reference this with what I stated in the outline:

From the source material in `/context_files/engagement_research/ilpa_how_we_got_here.md`:

"Responses from the QRSI comment period signaled positive trends in adoption. Nearly 70% of participants stated their intentions to adopt the updated ILPA Reporting Template. This represents a marked improvement over the existing adoption rate for the 2016 template version, which sits about 50% currently. Furthermore, of those surveyed on the new ILPA Performance Template, approximately 52% intend to adopt, including 100% of LPs surveyed."

This matches exactly what I stated in the outline:
- 70% adoption intention for Reporting Template ✅
- 52% adoption intention for Performance Template ✅  
- 50% current usage of 2016 template ✅
- 100% LP support for Performance Template ✅

The statistics are accurately sourced and correctly attributed. Now let me check technical accuracy.

Frequently Asked Questions | 6
Reporting Template
What are the key changes to the latest version of the Reporting Template?
By section, notable changes are as follows:
Cash/Non-Cash Flows: Added more details to the Cash / Non-Cash Flows section to capture
Offering/Syndication Costs, Placement Fees and Partner Transfers.
Management Fees: Added gross-to-net reconciliation of management fees. Step-by-step netting 
of rebates, waivers and offsets.
Partnership Expenses: Broke out Internal Chargebacks (i.e., Internal Staff/Related Persons) from
the external Partnership Expenses to isolate Expenses Allocated/Paid to the GP or Related Persons.
Partnership Expenses: Introduced more granular external Partnership Expenses in key areas 
such as Third-Party Valuations, Third-Party Investigation and Examination Fees/Expenses, and 
Subscription Facility Fees/Interest.
Offset Categories/Portfolio Company Fees: Expanded on the section to capture arrangement 
fees, origination fees, and consulting fees.
Carried Interest: Consolidated the reconciliation for accrued/earned/paid carried interest (formerly 
referred to as Accrued Incentive Allocation) with the Capital Accounts Statement section.
Other Structural Updates: Removed Level 1 and Level 2 structuring regarding the level of detail 
provided. Uniform level of detail required across all GPs within Partnership Expenses and Offsets 
sections. Further, removed the ability to modify the template by LPs and GPs alike.
For comprehensive guidance on template changes, please refer to the ‘Template Guide – Changes
Overview’ file.
How flexible will the new template be? Can it accommodate a wide variety of 
asset classes?
In an effort to increase standardization, we are encouraging that as few modifications be made to 
the template as possible. We have made some adjustments accordingly:
• Tiered Content: ILPA’s 2016 Reporting Template incorporated a tiered reporting structure.
Level 1 data represented high-level summary content, and Level 2 data introduced additional
granularity. The new template removes tiered content. We have received overwhelming
feedback suggesting that GPs should be able to provide granular detail to match their ledgers.
• Asset class-specific features: We have added “arrangement fees” to portfolio company fees/
offsets; however, no further asset class-specific line items have been added to the template.
• GP Modifications to the template: ILPA’s 2016 Reporting Template offered guidance into
acceptable modifications to the template. We have removed this guidance in an effort to
create more standardization and help promote greater automation of report creation and
ingestion.

Key Features of the 
Performance Template 
The Performance Template is intended to supplement the quarterly reporting provided by GPs as part 
of their standard reporting package, including financial statements (i.e., audited and unaudited financial 
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, IFRS or other comprehensive basis of accounting) 
as mandated by the Fund’s Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) and other governing documents and 
jurisdictional requirements and, where applicable, the accompanying Partners’ Capital Account Statement 
(PCAP). It should be used on a go-forward basis for Funds launched on or after Q1 2026.
To support a smooth adoption by all parties of the Performance Template, emphasis was placed on balancing 
simplicity with a deeper dive into more insightful transaction data to meet the current needs of the industry.
Key features of the Performance Template include (non-exhaustive list):
• Introduction of a Cash Flow table to provide investors with the transaction types, dates and amounts
needed for the recalculation of fund-level performance metrics.
• Introduction of a fund-level transaction type mapping table to standardize the calculation
methodology of the fund-level (fund-to-investor) performance metrics.
• Maps impact of each transaction type on metrics calculated “With the Impact of Fund-level
Subscription Facilities” and “Without the Impact of Fund-level Subscription Facilities”
• Maps impact of each transaction type on gross and net return metrics

I've identified two additional key performance template nuances. The methodology now offers granular calculation options with multiple approach variants. There's a sophisticated subscription facility impact analysis that provides comprehensive metric calculations under different scenarios. Importantly, the implementation is strategically phased, targeting new funds launching in Q1 2026 as the initial rollout period.
