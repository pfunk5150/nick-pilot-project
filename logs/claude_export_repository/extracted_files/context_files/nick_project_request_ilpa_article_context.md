Mike, here’s a rundown of what I’m looking to do:

**Objective:**  Write a 2-3 page thought leadership article about the updated ILPA Reporting Template and new ILPA Performance Template.

**Purpose of article:**  To inform market participants (namely CFOs and finance executives of private equity funds) about the release of updated ILPA Reporting Template and new ILPA Performance Template, and to describe the key aspects of the templates.

**Intended audience:**  CFOs and finance executives of private equity funds.

**Resources:**
- I’ve attached 2 zip folders (1 for the updated Reporting Template; 1 for the new Performance Template) which contain the final versions and all supporting materials (suggested guidance, supplemental resources)
- There is additional information about both templates on the ILPA website – the [Reporting Template](https://ilpa.org/industry-guidance/templates-standards-model-documents/reporting-template/) and [Performance Template](https://ilpa.org/industry-guidance/templates-standards-model-documents/performance-template/) each have their own page

**Immediate ask:**

Can you run all of this through your AI programs and see what it can produce?

**I need at least a quality outline for an article by the end of next week (June 19 or 20).**

I’ll give you a few hundred for this to make it worth your while!   LMK if you need more direction.

Thanks man!

Nick
