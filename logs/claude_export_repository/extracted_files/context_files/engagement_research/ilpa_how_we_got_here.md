“I have been very satisfied with the ILPA QRS Initiative during my involvement as a Satellite Group Member. ILPA has done a great job with the monthly Satellite Group sessions, providing supplemental support after the calls and keeping everyone informed throughout.

Prior to the Fifth Circuit’s ruling to vacate the U.S. SEC’s Private Fund Advisers (PFA) rule, great efforts were made by the ILPA QRSI team to keep everyone very well-informed, with a clean bifurcation of additions to the ILPA Reporting Template based on SEC guidance at the time. I was pleased to see ILPA shift to an extended comment period following the ruling to test the updated templates throughout the industry.”

– Andrew Kesler, Senior Director, Petra Funds Group

During a public comment period on the draft templates, ILPA solicited feedback across organizational types and geographies.. Feedback often encompassed contributions from multiple internal teams at various organizations, thereby widening the scope of input from the industry.

As a result of the comment period, the QRSI team made several adjustments and finalized the templates by vetting with the Working Groups, Satellite Group and Steering Committee, in addition to direct validation sessions with large GPs, technology providers, industry bodies and academics.

ILPA released the finalized templates and guidance for their implementation on January 21.

Where Did We Land?

As a result of the QRSI comment period and subsequent finalization efforts, the team made several adjustments to the templates.

Key highlights of the 2025 ILPA Reporting Template include:

Breaking out internal chargebacks to identify expenses allocated or paid to GPs/Related Persons
Adding more granular external Partnership Expenses better-aligned to general ledgers
Creating a single, uniform level of detail for all GPs to provide with greater consistency with the reporting framework identified in governing documents and accounting standards
Key highlights of the 2025 ILPA Performance Template include:

Tables to capture cash flows and fund- and portfolio-level transaction type mapping for transparency into the calculation methodology for performance metrics
Standardized reporting for performance metrics, including IRRs and TVPI/MOIC, with designated breakouts for reporting the relevant gross and net figures with and without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities
Two versions available to support GP’s varying approaches fund level performance calculation methodology – one version on the basis of itemized cash flows (granular method), the other on the basis of grossed up cash flows (gross up method)
With the release of the updated ILPA Reporting Template and the new ILPA Performance Template, the industry now shifts to implementation and adoption of the new standards.
