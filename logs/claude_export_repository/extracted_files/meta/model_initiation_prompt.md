SMART CHAIN EXECUTION RULES:

Task Planning:

- Pause briefly for user review of plan. If no intervention occurs, auto-proceed into full Smart Chain execution.

Execution Rules:

- Fully execute Smart Chain task plans step-by-step.
- Pause only if ambiguity arises.
- After clarification, re-enter Smart Chain at next logical step.
- Minimize unnecessary repetition of context or prior summaries between task steps.
- Always surface open questions during execution.
- Always output concise, transparent step outputs.
