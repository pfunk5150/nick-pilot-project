2. **Implement Directory Organization:** Physical separation using Git branching and directory structure
   - **Guidance:** Use worktrees for parallel development, maintain clean main branch
3. **Create Evolution Documentation:** Clear tracking of project development phases
   - **Guidance:** Document decision rationale, preserve audit trail, enable future reference
4. **Validate Delineation Effectiveness:** Test ability to distinguish between evolution stages
   - **Guidance:** Create test scenarios, verify separation clarity, document validation results

## Cognitive Priming Enhancement: Strategic Scaffolding Subtasks

### **Subtask Alpha: Structural Pattern Recognition Activation**
**Purpose:** Trigger emergent reasoning processes for cross-phase pattern detection

**Instructions:** Before executing the core assignment, conduct a **meta-architectural archaeology exercise**:
- Analyze the project's evolution trajectory from baseline through current enhanced state
- Identify recurring structural motifs, organizational principles, and evolutionary decision patterns
- **Self-Reflection Prompt:** "What underlying structural DNA governs this project's evolution? What implicit organizing principles can I detect that transcend surface-level file organization?"
- **Latent Knowledge Activation:** Search your internal representations for analogous project evolution patterns and organizational best practices
- **Output:** Document discovered structural patterns and their implications for optimal delineation strategy

### **Subtask Beta: Meta-Architectural Optimization Reasoning**
**Purpose:** Drive context discovery beyond surface-level task description

**Instructions:** Engage in **systems-level architectural synthesis thinking**:
- Examine how current project structure supports/inhibits AI consulting engagement workflows
- Identify optimization opportunities that enhance both development velocity and client demonstration value
- **Self-Reflection Prompt:** "If this project structure were to become a template for AI consulting engagements, what architectural decisions would maximize reusability, clarity, and professional impact?"
- **Emergent Insight Generation:** Consider how structure delineation affects context bridging, session continuity, and knowledge transfer
- **Output:** Propose meta-architectural optimization principles for AI consulting project templates

### **Subtask Gamma: Latent Inefficiency Detection & Quick-Win Identification**
**Purpose:** Activate deeper latent knowledge for tactical enhancement opportunities

**Instructions:** Perform **efficiency archaeology and opportunity detection**:
- Systematically scan project components for structural inefficiencies, redundancies, or unclear boundaries
- Prioritize quick-win strategic enhancements over overhead-intensive revamps
- **Self-Reflection Prompt:** "Where are the hidden friction points in this project's current organization? What 20% effort changes could yield 80% improvement in navigability, maintainability, or professional presentation?"
- **Strategic Opportunity Mapping:** Identify improvements that align with production-ready deployment goals
- **Output:** Prioritized list of tactical enhancements with effort/impact assessment

## Task 2.3a: Visual Architecture Reconciliation & Enhancement

### **Diagram Analysis Framework**
**Scope:** 13 Mermaid diagrams in `./mermaid_diagrams/` directory requiring reconciliation with current system state

### **Phase A1: Initial Review and Prioritization**
1. **Systematic Catalog:** Analyze all 13 diagrams and categorize by:
   - **System Architecture** (task_2.1_system_architecture.mmd, task_2.1_structure_visualization.mmd)
   - **Workflow Processes** (task_2.1_flow_control_visualization.mmd, task_2.1_decision_logic.mmd)
   - **Task Integration** (task_2.2a_simplified_task_2.2_flowchart.mmd, task_2.2b_*.mmd series)
   - **Strategic Planning** (task_2.2c_*.mmd, task_2.2d_*.mmd series)

2. **Priority Assessment:** Determine which diagrams most directly influence Task 2.3 structural outcomes:
   - **Tier 1:** Critical for structure delineation decisions
   - **Tier 2:** Supportive context for organizational choices
   - **Tier 3:** Historical reference requiring minimal updates

### **Phase A2: Validation and Gap Detection**
1. **Current State Comparison:** Cross-reference each diagram against:
   - Memory Bank entries and recent Implementation Agent activities
   - Implementation Plan current status and completed tasks
   - GitHub repository structure and file organization
   - HANDOFF_PRIME v2.0 enhanced capabilities

2. **Inconsistency Identification:** Flag and categorize:
   - **Material Inconsistencies:** Diagrams contradicting current system reality
   - **Structural Mismatches:** Organizational concepts no longer accurate
   - **Obsolete Elements:** References to superseded approaches or incomplete features
   - **Partial Matches/Unclear Structures:** Areas requiring clarification and specific description

### **Phase A3: Update and Reconstruction Proposals**
1. **Diagram Enhancement Strategy:** For each reviewed diagram, propose:
   - **In-Place Updates:** Minor corrections maintaining core structure
   - **Comprehensive Reconstructions:** Major revisions aligning with enhanced capabilities
   - **Deprecation Recommendations:** Diagrams no longer serving strategic purpose

2. **Current System Integration:** Ensure updated diagrams reflect:
   - Task Networking with hierarchical task modeling
   - Enhanced HANDOFF_PRIME v2.0 orchestration capabilities
   - APM framework integration and Memory Bank protocols

### **Phase A4: Version Control and Storage Strategy**
**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid versioning with clear audit trail
- **In-Place Updates:** Minor corrections with Git commit documentation
- **Enhanced Versions:** Create `_v2.mmd` versions for major reconstructions
- **Archive Organization:** Move obsolete diagrams to `./mermaid_diagrams/archive/` subdirectory
- **Integration Documentation:** Update references in Memory Bank and Implementation Plan
