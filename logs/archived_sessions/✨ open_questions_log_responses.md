## 🔍 **CLARIFICATION ITEMS REQUIRING USER INPUT**

### **📋 ARTICLE SCOPE & EMPHASIS**

**Q1: Technical Depth Level**
- How technical should the article be? Should we focus on high-level benefits or include specific implementation details?
- Should we explain the differences between granular vs. gross-up methodologies in detail?

> **A1:** Let's balance high-level benefits with specific implementation details that **implicitly** incline the CFO-level reader to want to initiate follow-up discussions with a BDO SME professional.

**Q2: Article Structure Preference**
- Does Nick prefer a specific structure (e.g., Executive Summary → Background → Key Changes → Implementation Implications)?
- Should we mirror the BDO sample article structure exactly or adapt it?

> **A2:** Let's use the proposed structure (Exec Summary → Background → Key Changes → Implications) as a starting point. Feel free to adapt it slightly if it improves the narrative flow, but the BDO sample is a good model to keep in mind for tone and professionalism.

**Q3: Comparative Analysis**
- Should we include explicit comparisons between the old (2016) and new (2025) Reporting Template?
- How much emphasis on the "newness" of the Performance Template since it's the first standardized version?

> **A3:** Yes, a concise comparison to the 2016 template is crucial for context. Emphasize that the Performance Template is a new, significant step towards standardization. Frame it as an evolution, highlighting the benefits of the new additions without getting bogged down in a line-by-line comparison.

### **🎯 AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS**

**Q4: CFO Decision Framework**
- What specific decisions are PE CFOs facing regarding these templates? (Adoption timing, system changes, resource allocation?)
- Should we include cost/benefit analysis or ROI considerations?

> **A4:** Focus on the key decisions: adoption timing, system/process adjustments, and resource planning. A high-level cost/benefit analysis would be very effective, framing adoption not as a compliance burden but as a strategic advantage in investor communications and operational efficiency.

**Q5: Industry Context**
- Should we mention specific competitors or industry leaders who have endorsed the templates?
- How much regulatory context (SEC PFA Rules) should we include?

> **A5:** Reference the SEC PFA Rules as a key driver for transparency, positioning the ILPA templates as a solution that aligns with regulatory direction. Mentioning broad industry endorsement (e.g., 'leading LPs and GPs') is good, but let's avoid naming specific competitors.

### **📊 VISUAL & PRESENTATION ELEMENTS**

**Q6: Visual Complexity**
- What level of visual sophistication is appropriate? (Simple tables vs. complex diagrams)
- Should we include template screenshots or sample data?

> **A6:** Aim for visuals that are professional but easy to understand. Use simple tables to compare key changes, and include one or two anonymized screenshots or data snippets to highlight major points. Use well-designed graphs with a distinctive visual style to show real insights and their connection to added value. For flowcharts, use clean formatting and smart line styling to make complex ideas easier to grasp. Let the design do some of the explaining. Don’t present obvious points or reworded platitudes as unique insights. Always favor clarity over detail—avoid diagrams that are too busy or hard to follow.

**Q7: Data Points**
- Should we include specific statistics (70% adoption intention, 52% for Performance Template)?
- Are there any BDO-specific insights or client experiences we should reference?

> **A7:** Using industry stats like adoption rates is great for adding weight to our argument. We can weave in anonymized BDO client experiences as brief, illustrative examples to showcase our expertise, but keep them general.

### **⏰ TIMELINE & DELIVERABLE SPECIFICATIONS**

**Q8: Deliverable Format**
- Final format preference: Word doc, PDF, or other?
- Should the outline include detailed bullet points or high-level section headers?

> **A8:** Deliver the outline and draft as a Word document. The outline should be detailed enough to clearly show the flow and key points under each section, so use detailed bullet points.

**Q9: Review Process**
- Does Nick want to review the outline before full draft development?
- Any specific reviewers or stakeholders beyond Nick?

> **A9:** Yes, I will review the outline as (as Engagement Director) before you proceed to the full draft. For now, I am the only stakeholder. I will pull in others if needed after my review.

### **🔒 SENSITIVITY & COMPLIANCE**

**Q10: Confidentiality Considerations**
- Are there any topics we should avoid or handle carefully? (Comment period feedback, industry criticism?)
- Should we position this as BDO thought leadership or more neutral industry analysis?

> **A10:** Position this firmly as BDO thought leadership. Let's maintain a positive and proactive tone. Avoid dwelling on past criticisms or contentious feedback from the comment period. The focus is on the value and implementation of the *final* templates.

**Q11: Attribution & Sources**
- How should we handle attribution to ILPA materials?
- Any specific BDO disclaimers or qualifications needed?

> **A11:** Attribute to ILPA clearly where appropriate (e.g., when referencing the templates directly). We should include a standard BDO disclaimer. Legal can provide the exact wording later, but for now, just a placeholder is fine.
