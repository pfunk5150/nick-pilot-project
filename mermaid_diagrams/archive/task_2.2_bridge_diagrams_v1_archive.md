# Task 2.2 Bridge Diagrams Archive (v1)

**Archive Date:** July 9, 2025
**Archive Reason:** Consolidated into unified context bridge architecture v2
**Replacement:** `task_2.2_unified_context_bridge_v2.mmd`

## Archived Diagrams

### Original Bridge Components (v1)
- `task_2.2a_simplified_task_2.2_flowchart.mmd` - Basic task flow
- `task_2.2b_bridge_tasks_diagram_v1.mmd` - Context bridging tasks
- `task_2.2b_context_tasks_diagram_v1.mmd` - Context preservation tasks
- `task_2.2b_handoff_tasks_diagram_v1.mmd` - Session handoff tasks
- `task_2.2d_smart_chain_continuation_path.mmd` - Smart Chain continuation

### Consolidation Rationale

**Meta-Discovery Integration:** The original v1 diagrams were created before the recognition of the dual-architecture fusion (EA Master Model + APM Enhancement). The unified v2 diagram incorporates:

1. **Smart Chain Context Analysis** - Preserves EA Master Model orchestration patterns
2. **APM Context Parsing** - Maintains systematic agent coordination
3. **Dual-Architecture Synthesis** - Fuses both approaches seamlessly
4. **Enhanced Handoff Protocol** - HANDOFF_PRIME v2.0 with dual activation

### Historical Value

These diagrams represent the evolution of thinking toward the current dual-architecture understanding and are preserved for:
- Audit trail of architectural development
- Reference for future enhancement iterations
- Documentation of pre-fusion design patterns
