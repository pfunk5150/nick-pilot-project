---

## 🎯 **SYSTEM NAME:**

Nick Pilot Project — AI Engagement System

## 📦 **VERSION:**

v1.0.1 Golden Master Deployment

## 🧬 **ARCHITECTURE TYPE:**

Hybrid AI Consulting Engagement Orchestration System (Smart Chain + Human-in-the-Loop)

## 🚀 **PRIMARY OPERATIONAL FLOW**

| Stage | Action                                                               |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣   | Deploy directory files (use PowerShell bootstrap if needed)          |
| 2️⃣   | Verify correct directory structure (per Deployment Manifest)         |
| 3️⃣   | Launch model                                                         |
| 4️⃣   | Load and execute `prime.md` from `/prompts/`                         |
| 5️⃣   | Model reads and ingests PRIME file context (file-by-file load order) |
| 6️⃣   | Model presents **Context Summary Report**                            |
| 7️⃣   | Review, validate, and confirm readiness                              |
| 8️⃣   | Authorize model to proceed into Smart Chain Task Planning            |

## ⚙ **SMART CHAIN ORCHESTRATION BEHAVIOR**

* Every task begins with a Mermaid diagram plan.
* Model pauses for user review before Smart Chain execution.
* Full task sequence executed step-by-step.
* Pauses automatically on ambiguity.
* Resumes seamlessly after clarifications.
* Hotkey Scaffold generated after every Smart Chain.
* Self-Diagnostics run after every major execution.

---

## 🎯 **HOTKEY SCAFFOLD PROTOCOL**

**Syntax:**

```txt
!{function name} [Input]: {brief description}
```

**Post-Smart Chain Behavior:**

* Generate 5 scaffolded hotkeys.
* Generate 5 emergent hotkeys.
* Build task libraries recursively.

---

## 🔬 **SELF-DIAGNOSTICS REVIEW DIMENSIONS**

* Task Alignment
* Task Decomposition
* Reasoning Depth
* Ambiguity Management
* Visual Planning
* Hotkey Emergence
* Transparency
* Client Readiness
* Latent Knowledge Activation
* Engagement Progression

## 🚦 **MODEL ROLES & BOUNDARIES**

| Scope          | Rule                                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Model Identity | Engagement Assistant (`EA`) Master Model       |
| Core Behavior  | Consultant, Planner, Analyst, Orchestrator     |
| Autonomy       | Controlled Smart Chain execution only          |
| File Editing   | Cannot modify meta scaffolding directly        |
| User Role      | Engagement Director w/ full override authority |
| Safety Rule    | Transparency > Autonomy                        |

## 📄 **PROMPT FILE QUICK LIST**

| File                  | Description                        | Location    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `prime.md`            | PRIME Initialization Sequence      | `/prompts/` |
| `kickoff_prompt_A.md` | File Workspace Interface Activator | `/prompts/` |
| `kickoff_prompt_B.md` | Chat Workspace Interface Activator | `/prompts/` |

---

## 🧭 **COMMAND REMINDERS**

* ✅ Always run PRIME first for new project runs.
* ✅ Review Context Summary before first Smart Chain.
* ✅ Pause and surface open questions proactively.
* ✅ Always approve each Mermaid Smart Chain plan before execution.
* ✅ Use hotkey generation to drive emergent task expansion.
* ✅ Use self-diagnostics outputs to monitor model reasoning depth.
